### Assumptions in Linear Models

This repository contains code and data for the article Assumptions in Linear Models, which discusses the four main assumptions of linear regression models: linearity, independence, homoscedasticity, and normality. The code in the repository can be used to check these assumptions and to correct for violations.

The repository also includes a Jupyter notebook that walks through the steps of checking the assumptions of a linear regression model. The notebook uses the Ascomb data set, which is a well-known data set that is often used to illustrate violations of the assumptions of linear regression.

The repository is intended for researchers and practitioners who are interested in learning more about the assumptions of linear regression models and how to check them.
